The Giraffe is one of the most interesting creatures on earth, it is the tallest land animal on the planet and it has the tallest neck among all creatures. It is originated in Africa and it inhabits the savannahs, grass lands and woodlands.  Although it has thin legs, it has a very strong kick that can lead to fatal injuries to any animal that tries to prey on it, especially lions which are more likely to target giraffes than any other animals. The giraffe would fight with other giraffes using its neck rather than its legs because legs can be fatal and dominance in the giraffe family is only shown by using the neck. The giraffeâ€™s appearances are similar to camels in terms of features such as hooves, tall legs and long tongues, and its body movements are also similar because both animals have 4 long legs.
